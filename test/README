Integration and regression test collection for LAMMPS

This directory holds multiple collections of tests for
testing a LAMMPS installation. Each directory contains
a collection of tests that test similar features in LAMMPS.

Run tests with make test MACH=<build make target> MPICMD=<MPI launch command> LMPFLAGS=<additional flags for LAMMPS> TAG=<tag for logfile>

Example:
make test MACH=mpi MPICMD="mpirun -np 2" LMPFLAGS="-pkg omp 2 -sf omp" TAG="-2xmpi-2xomp"

This command will recurse through all the subdirectories and will use the
"make mpi" executable and run all tests with 2 MPI tasks and 2 OpenMP threads.

Remove all log files with "make clean"
