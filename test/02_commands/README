Integration and regression test collection for LAMMPS: Command tests

This directory contains simple run examples for testing individual commands.
The purpose is similar to what would be done with unit tests, but without
using a unit test framework and rather try to verify that a command has the
desired effect from LAMMPS script commands.

Suggested settings: All inputs should use "timers off" to turn of timer
output and statistics and also use "info all" right before the run 
command to print out some general internall settings for the input.

All input files should be named in.<command>-### (with <command> standing for
the command to be tested and # standing for a digit).
