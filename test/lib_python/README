Integration and regression test collection for LAMMPS: Python wrapper tests.

This directory contains simple run examples for testing the LAMMPS python
wrapper and through it the library interface. It contains some simple run
tests (that simply have to complete) and some more thorough unit tests using
the PyUnit framework to exercise the python code in lammps.py.

All runnable python input files should be named in.<name>-###.py
