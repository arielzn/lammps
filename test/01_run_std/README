Integration and regression test collection for LAMMPS: Simple runs

This directory contains simple complete run examples, e.g. the benchmark
or example inputs that should validate that basic standard MD simulations
can be run successfully with the selected executable.

Suggested settings: All inputs should use "timers off" to turn of timer
output and statistics and also use "info all" right before the run 
command to print out some general internall settings for the input.

All input files should be named in.### (with # standing for a digit) so
that inputs will always be run in the same sequence. Use the first digits
to define categories.
